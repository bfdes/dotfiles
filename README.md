# dotfiles

Dotfiles and installation script for software development on Mac.

## Requirements

The setup files support machines running macOS Catalina or later.

## Usage

Navigate to the repository root and make the script `install.sh` executable with `chmod +x ./install.sh`. Then run the script with `install.sh`.

Some commands require root permissions, so you may be asked for your password when running `install.sh`.

Note that non-idempotent operations are commented-out by default.
